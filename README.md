This is a project for my INFM313 class, and it the entire application is composed of two repositories.

This repository is exclusively for the application's backend, while the frontend source code can be viewed here: https://www.github.com/johnnyyork13/313-final-project

The purpose of this application is to simulate a library database that permits users to add, view, and remove books.

Since I did not implement any kind of authentication or login functionality, this application allows anyone to update and remove books in the database.

Thanks!
